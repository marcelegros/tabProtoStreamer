FREQUENCY BAND DETECTION

DFT algorithms allow for the analysis of 

    highestFreq < sampleFreq / 2

    (where sampleFreq = sampleRate for all intents and purposes)



FREQUENCY RESOLUTION

(sampleRate / windowSizeSamps) gives us an interesting metric. Units of 1/s. 
It's usually the equivalent of ( 1 / windowSizeSeconds)

This provides us with the frequency resolution of the sample. 
(...because 1 10 HZ period is capable of fitting in the window.)

So, a window of 0.1s will have a frequency resolution of roughly 10 Hz. 


A wiider window provides us with higher resolution!

In our implementation, we'll likley have to cut the resolution when the next note plays, or do some subractive synthesis in analysis.
